ISSUES
====================

Abstractize col view
- now its so bloat
- make dumb view layer, that knows only columns and lines in them
- make "heart" classes for each view layout: col as month/week/day/(hour)
  heart class interface draft:
  - get column of date
  - get line of date
  - get column lines (for each column)
  - get column label
  - get supercolumns (in columns unit)
- handle activities model with view heart

MONTH column
- make month col
- require dealing with flexible column lines count

WEEK column
- add weeks first date to label or column
- or think out display of date to each day of week in column

View dragging
- make draggable only headers bar
- add navigation buttons left/right (half a screen scroll?)

Far zoom activities
- at far zoom levels activities are small boxes
- brainstorming:
  - on hover expand for actual "in pixel" activity
  - enlarge important/bigger activities (inapropriate to view measure)
  

HARD things!!!
---------------

Activity types
- implement models for all activity types
- implement manual handling of activities

Long term activity
- visualize deadline 

Activity category
- make categories
- capable of hiding/showing each of them

Sleep time collapse/expand
- make it possible to collapse/expand sleep time hours (or range of hours/days by view layout)


VISIONS - DO NOT IMPLEMENT
--------------------------

Locations
- coloring of activities depending of location

Mutual activities
- enable more activities parallel
